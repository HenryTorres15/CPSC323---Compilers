## Introduction
A simple lexer that makes use of at least one finite state machine.

## Usage Information
1. Python 3 is required to run this program.
    - The official Tuffix distribution should come with Python 3.
    - To check if you have Python 3, open your terminal emulator and follow the instructions for your OS.
        - Tuffix/Linux: python3 --version
        - Windows: py --version

2. Make sure all necessary files are present in the same project directory.
   Only the "Required files" and "Input files" are needed to test the program.
   Here is a list of all the files:
    - "Required files" to run the program:
        - Lexer.py			----	the Lexer class
        - LexerConstants.py	----	set definitions and constants
        - Ratify.py			----	the main script file

    - "Input files" for testing the program:
        - test1.txt			----	test file 1, <10 lines
        - test2.txt			----	test file 2, <20 lines
        - test3.txt			----	test file 3, >20 lines

    - "Output files" for the given input files:
        - test1-out.txt     ----    output of test file 1
        - test2-out.txt     ----    output of test file 2
        - test3-out.txt     ----    output of test file 3

    - "Other files" used for testing and development:
        - LexerTest.py      ----    Unit tests
        - RegexLex.py       ----    Testing regular expression correctness

3. Navigate your terminal emulator to the directory containing the project files.
    - Tuffix/Linux: cd ...path/to/project/directory
    - Windows: cd ...path\to\project\directory 

4. Using Python3, Run the main script file Ratify.py.
   You can specify the input and output files (in that order) as command line arguments.
    - Tuffix/Linux: python3 Ratify.py test1.txt myoutput.txt
    - Windows: py -3 Ratify.py test1.txt myoutput.txt

    - If no command line arguments are given, the program will prompt you for file names. Please follow the command prompt.
    - The input file must match your source code file name. The output file must also be provided. For the output file name, be careful not to use the name of an existing file, otherwise its contents will be replaced.
